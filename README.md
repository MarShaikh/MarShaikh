  # Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I am a Research Engineer with a keen interest in Natural Language Processing (NLP) and its applications, as well as in developing software tools for Data Science and Machine Learning.

## ðŸ’¼ Professional Interests
- **NLP**: Exploring applications and advancing skills in natural language processing.
- **Data Science & ML**: Building models and deploying software tools for data science and machine learning projects.
- **Applied ML**: Applying machine learning techniques to diverse domains including genomics and infectious disease modeling.

## ðŸ’» Skills
- **Programming Languages**: Python, R, Bash
- **ML Frameworks**: TensorFlow, Keras, PyTorch
- **Data Science Tools**: scikit-learn, NumPy, pandas
- **DevOps**: Azure, Google Cloud, Docker, Terraform
- **Full-stack Development**: End-to-end machine learning web applications
- **Geospatial**: STAC, GeoJSON, raster data processing

## ðŸ”­ Current Projects
- **Real-time Infectious Disease Risk System**: Developing a real-time system for infectious disease risk assessment at LSHTM, working with statistical models to model count data for Lassa fever.
  - Implementing a STAC (SpatioTemporal Asset Catalog) server for efficient management and distribution of climate data relevant to disease transmission.
  - Developing API endpoints for serving processed climate indices and model predictions.

- **Transformer Model Fine-tuning**: Implementing efficient fine-tuning of an MSATransformer using Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) for sequence modeling applications, focusing on computational efficiency for large models.

## ðŸŒ± Ongoing Learning
- Continually improving my NLP skills.
- Exploring efficient fine-tuning methods for large language models in specialized domains.
