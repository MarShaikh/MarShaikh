## ðŸ”­ Current Projects
- **Real-time Spatio-Temporal Forecasting System**
    - Pioneered the application of Conformal Prediction to generate reliable 95% uncertainty intervals for time-series forecasts.
    - Developed advanced statistical modeling approaches for zero-inflated count data, improving prediction accuracy by 20%.
    - Architected and deployed a production-ready API on Azure (using RestRServe, Docker, and Terraform) for real-time data surveillance, reducing analysis time by 40%.
    - Implemented a cloud-native STAC API to ingest and manage large-scale geospatial datasets (e.g., CHIRPS, MODIS), ensuring high data integrity.
    - Established a CI/CD pipeline with GitHub Actions to automate monthly data updates, accelerating run times by up to 95%.

- **Efficient Transformer Model Adaptation**
    - Implemented and optimized parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) methods like LoRA for large transformer architectures, reducing computational resource needs by 60% while retaining 95% of full fine-tuning performance.
    - Engineered custom data preprocessing pipelines for complex, large-scale sequence data, enabling the analysis of inputs 40% larger than was possible with standard model limitations.

## ðŸŒ± Ongoing Learning
- Deepening my understanding of advanced statistical models for complex, high-dimensional data.
