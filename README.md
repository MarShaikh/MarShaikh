# Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I am a Research Software Engineer specializing in the application of machine learning to public health, with a strong interest in Natural Language Processing (NLP) and the development of robust software tools for Data Science and Machine Learning.

## ðŸ’¼ Professional Interests
- **Applied ML**: Architecting and deploying machine learning models for diverse domains, with a current focus on infectious disease forecasting, genomics, and geospatial analysis.
- **Data Engineering & Geospatial**: Building and managing cloud-native data platforms (STAC APIs) to handle large-scale geospatial datasets for environmental and epidemiological modeling.
- **ML & AI**: Advancing skills in statistical modeling, including Conformal Prediction for reliable uncertainty quantification and exploring efficient fine-tuning methods (LoRA) for Protein Language Models.
- **Cloud & MLOps**: Establishing and automating CI/CD pipelines for model deployment, data updates, and infrastructure management on cloud platforms like Azure.

## ðŸ’» Skills
- **Languages & Libraries**: Python, R, PyTorch, TensorFlow, scikit-learn, Pandas, NumPy, Hugging Face
- **ML & AI**: Supervised & Unsupervised Learning, Deep Learning, Generative AI (LLMs), Statistical Modeling, Conformal Prediction
- **Cloud & MLOps**: Azure, Google Cloud Platform (GCP), AWS, Docker, Terraform, CI/CD, GitHub Actions, Git
- **Data Engineering & Geospatial**: SQL, PostgreSQL, ETL, Data Pipelines, STAC API

## ðŸ”­ Current Projects
- **Lassa Fever Forecasting**: Pioneered the application of Conformal Prediction to generate reliable 95% uncertainty intervals for Lassa fever forecasts. Developed statistical modeling approaches for zero-inflated count data, improving prediction accuracy by 20%.
- **Production-Ready API**: Architected and deployed a production-ready API for Lassa fever surveillance on Azure using RestRServe, Docker, and Terraform, which reduced analysis time by 40%.
- **Cloud-Native Geospatial Data Management**: Deployed and managed a cloud-native STAC API on Azure for ingesting and managing large-scale geospatial datasets (e.g., CHIRPS, MODIS), ensuring high data integrity.
- **Automation & CI/CD**: Established a CI/CD pipeline with GitHub Actions to automate monthly data updates, accelerating run times by up to 95% by optimizing R package dependency caching.
- **Efficient Fine-Tuning of Protein Language Models**: Implemented and optimized fine-tuning methods using LoRA (Low-Rank Adaptation), reducing computational resource requirements by 60% while maintaining 95% of full fine-tuning performance.  
- **Genomic Data Preprocessing**: Developed custom data preprocessing pipelines for complex biological datasets, enabling the analysis of 40% larger sequence inputs than was possible with standard model limitations.

## ðŸŒ± Ongoing Learning
- Deepening my understanding of advanced statistical models for spatio-temporal data.
- Exploring and implementing various MLOps strategies to enhance the reproducibility and scalability of machine learning workflows.
- Researching novel approaches for applying large language models to scientific data extraction and analysis.
